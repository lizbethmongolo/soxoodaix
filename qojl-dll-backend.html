There have been no issues with corruption for the last number of years. Users have different versions of Office but, aside from the database design staff , every user uses Access Runtime 03 to run the mde.

I'm revisiting one of my old, unfinished projects (https://github.com/ecumene/couchcraft) (please excuse how terrible the repo is), and I'd like to spice it up with some rust. It's a Minecraft mod to add gamepad / controller support, as well as some functionality to make the game easier to play for those with controllers.
