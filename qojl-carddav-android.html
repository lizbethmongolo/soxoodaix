I am taking small steps to improve my digital privacy. My first step was to use a calendar that I downloaded from F-Droid. I put all my calendar items into it and I plan on deleting my cal info from google and icloud and outlook. My issue is, I would like to back it up somehow or be able to sync it but it isn't tied to a service.would syncthings do this? I would also like to do this with contacts. Or am I just better off using a calender from Posteo or mailbox.org (https://mailbox.org). С почтовым сервером EVO как бэкэндом Outlook, iPhone и Android могут без труда расшарить почту, контакты, календари и задачи между собой и формально завершить экосистему программного обеспечения по совместной работе.  Would like to use something on the Syn as a central repository for contacts/calendars. Would need to be supported by iOS/Android contact/calendar apps. What do others do here? Or am I stuck with Google/outlook for widely supported contact/calendar syncing?.

Android 5.1 уже в очереди на раздачу OTA для смартфонов HTC One M7 и One M8 Google. Prior to owning an N4 and N5, I strictly owned iPhones and had all my contacts synced to Apple's iCloud service. Luckily for me, there's an awesome app on the Play Store called SmoothSync that merged all my iCloud contacts into my Nexus 5. I'm selling my backup iPhone 5S so that I can have cash to put towards a Sony Xperia Z3, what is a good method of backing up all the contacts on my N5? I'd prefer to have a method that stores the contacts online rather than solely on the device. 
CalDAV-Sync is a CalDAV client for Android to synchronize events and tasks. Due to its implementation as sync adapter it integrates seamlessly with the native calendar app and widgets. Also check out CardDAV. I decided to give nextcloud a shot today after giving up on owncloud last year. The install was painless and file sync works fine, but I'm shocked to find there is still no real contacts support. The app isn't enabled by default. Then I can't import contacts from the android app. I need to pay for a sketchy third party cardav app? Finally when I copy over the vcf the import fails with the same bug owncloud has had open for months. Why advertise it as a contact sharing platform I've been on Android for the last three years, and I'm thinking of switching to a Lumia 1020 for the delicious camera. Before I switch I need to know about Google intergration, and searching the web has not provided clear answers. My phone use depends on the following: Gmail. Google contacts. Google calendar. I'm wondering what level of integration I can achieve with these services? Not really interested in alternatives.thanks. Also interested in the quality / availability of the follo. The lack of calendar sync option between nextcloud and Android feels to me like a striking UX limitation that breaks the whole experience of using NextCloud. I understand that I can buy an Android sync app that will do that for me, but it's a bit striking that such a fundamental functionality is offered in form of a 3rd party paid app. Is there any plan to change that? Is that a technical limitation or a business/political choice. I'm really excited about the Ubuntu Touch project but on the other side also really disappointed because of the lack of some really important features. Most of all ActiveSync. This is just the de-facto standard for business email and available on all other competitive product (iOS, Android, Windows Mobile.) Also the integration of Owncloud would be nice as many people want to move away from google and co. I would love to see Ubuntu Phone being a success. Please Canonical add these features. 
I just got the G3 and I'm loving it, but I haven't really been able to set it up properly. Mainly, I'm having trouble syncing my contacts over and dealing with messages to/from other iPhones. Can anyone else who made a similar switch explain to me how they managed to sync up and get everything working in the transfer? I've tried to transfer my contacts a couple times now using various methods but I've been unsuccessful each time. I searched this subreddit before posting and noticed that people. Hi, We currently have the following systems with distinct, unsychronised contact lists/address books, on Android, iPhone, Mac & Windows clients: \- Starface cloud pbx solution with Address Book feature \- O365/Outlook utilising a Shared Mailbox Address Book (includes Colour Category functionality for Contacts) and Global Address Book/Organisation Contacts List (does not include Colour Category functionailty?!) \- Synology in-house servers with CardDAV Address Books.

I have been concerned for a while about Google and how much data it gathers about its users so I've been looking around for alternatives to Google Calendar and Contacts. I already use Safari with StartPage as my search engine.

I must say I am very pleased. As a home user I have just as good a user experience Hi, currently I'm using a simple mailbox service of my ISP and my calendars and contacts are synced via outlook.com (https://outlook.com), which is quite handy as synchronization with outlook 365 and my android is flawless and easy. Nevertheless I'd like to get my data on my own premise and I'm thinking of hosting a light-weight CalDav / CardDav Server like Radicale on my own server. The way I see it, CardDav / CalDav is well supposed on android but I will need a plugin I have Nextcloud running on separate server from my primary NGINX reverse proxy server. Everything works fine when connecting directly to my Nextcloud server (on LAN), but if I try to access the web GUI through the reverse proxy (through WAN) clicking "login" does nothing, or if my login is cached, I can see no files, and clicking buttons does nothing. Everything works perfectly fine though the Android app (locally and remote). Proxy NGINX file server { listen 80; listen I started searching in this sub about 1 year ago, how do it de-google my self and email was the 1st thing that I was really worried about.

I know that this might be a loaded question for some and could be a very personal answer for most. None the less i'd like some input on your view on this. Every time i dive deeper into the rabbithole i get to a point where i ask myself this question. Some examples: \- I went Google less on my Android smartphone for a couple of weeks. Setting this up is a major hassle \(if you don't want to loose to much functionality\). I set up Owncloud on my NAS, with CalDav and CardDav Sync. All requiring.
